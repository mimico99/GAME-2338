## Summary
This game was created in unity as a mobile game by a indie company named Noxy Games. It was released on both android and iOS in 2016 then later released on the nintendo switch in 2018. The game features a story book style art, calming music background and map exploration. The songlist were complete with hardcore and/or music that gets your blood craving for more.

The game is about a world that has lost their sound and color. You are controlling two characters that run around the rea "tuning" the places back to their original state. Tuning as in playing through the songs and reaching a certain score to fully restore the crystal,called the Notalium.

To start the game, you tap on a devoided crystal, you can pick between tune and purify. Purify means if you miss too many notes, the song will fail and your would have to start over again. You can change the speed on how fast you want the notes to come towards the edges of the circle. Last thing is difficulty that can range from Whisper to Master.

Once you complete the required setting for your customized gameplay, you are ready to start. Aside from completing the story, you can also do side quest that are in the form of DLCs to furthur enhance your skills. This game is also available on tablet, making it a easier playthrough of the game, considering it's a bigger screen and more room for hand movement.


## Final Thoughts
I love this game because it is unique compared to the many rythum games that i have played. I never played one with a storyline before and music that comes with the game. Not one where you have to manuelly put in the songs yoursef,made by other people. The storyline is still not complete, the levels update the same rate as a patch would come out for any game and i hope this game furthur keeps developing.
