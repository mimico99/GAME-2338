## Summary
Back in 2003 where the original Toontown was created, it was owned by Disney. Easy to tell by its wacky characters and way of how heavily they enforce child content. With a "legal guardian", you will not be able to experience the full potential of Toontown meaning typing almost anything u want. Another thing about Toontown was that u had to pay for a subscription to play. The game was stable until 2013 where Disney completely discontinued it until 2014 where the game was bought by a bunch of high schoolers and college students. Unknown group but they have managed to keep the game alive through donations and support. Another perk is that the game is now currently free and is not called "Toontown Rewritten."

The game is made of characters called toons who must defend against the evil cogs. The cogs are business men trying to rid the world of toons and their silly ways of living. You first go through a character creation and you can choose between different animals, colors and heights. There are four types of cogs: Sellsbot, Cashbots, Bossbots and Lawbots. Their levels range from 1 to 12. The high the number, the bigger they are and the harder they can become defeated. The RPG aspect of this game would be not by character level, but through what u use to defend against cogs, gags. There are seven categories of gags and each one you must learn and level up. Level 7 is the highest to achieve but can be time consuming. The quests are the important part of this game because without quests, you will never seem to progress until it is complete, you can have a total of for once you complete enough.

Although the battle interaction seems good, there is however a problem, most players experience and good amount of lag during and coming into battle. You would join someone else who is already in a battle and stand there until both players sync up to each other to continue. Sometimes, it wouldn't let you through and you must end up restarting the game. The world is made of up very familiar towns that includes Donald duck and Pluto. Each town has either 2 or 3 tunnels leading into either a street where cogs reside or an HQ which is made up of only one kind of cog type. Gags can run out and evenly you must buy more with the game currency, jelly beans which runs into another problem. Upon approaching the npc the buy your gags, players would back out and what seems to look like a freeze but really the game crashed and won't continue until you close out the game completely and reset.

The texture maps are simple, mostly 2D. The problem with that is, if you don't set the map correctly, it will start to flicker in and out of place whenever you move but something like that doesn't really affect your interactive gameplay. When I mentioned child oriented through, there is a speed chat and chat. Anybody under 13 can't use chat and must use the text that the game gives which makes it a little difficult to fully talk to other toons. Even with the privilege of chat, you can't fully what you want to say because it will be censored. 

## Final Thoughts
This game is childhood and it's unique compared to other games. I do get irritated when I must restart my game a couple of times, but I always end up coming back for the gameplay and friends. When Toontown was announced free was probably the best day i ever had. My favorite part would be the battle interaction and the different gags you are able to get throughout the game. You can even disguise yourself as a cog for a big boss fight in HQs which makes the game even more exciting.
