## Summary
Robot Unicorn Attack is one of the games offered by adult swim. This game can either be played on the pc or mobile. It features an endless runner platform where you have to jump and dodge the obstacles. You have 3 “wishes” to go as far as you can without dying. A unique feature is your ability to dash through breakable objects or to the next platform. 

This was just basic features across the Robot Unicorn series. The 2nd Robot Unicorn in my opinion was the best one. You were allowed to actually customize your unicorn and go to different worlds other than the default map you are placed in. What every free to play game comes with is micro transactions.

Most of the worlds required you to either pay money or use their in-game currency earned while collecting the rewards within each run. The in-game currency is reasonable with enough runs to the point where you won’t even notice. Another unique feature in gameplay is how long you run. Every few seconds, you will start to speed up and the map with start to zoom out where it will appear larger. There, you can see the top and bottom platforms easier. 


## Final Thoughts
This game is nostalgia to most people who come across the adult swim website. I played this game non-stop until I had to get a new phone. I didn’t talk about the 3rd game because so many things went downhill with the release. Too many features were taken out and a couple of glitches sprung. Many people complained, saying it wasn’t the same anymore so therefore, the 2nd will always be the best.
