### Rating
7/10
## Summary
This was a unique side scroller game back in it's day. It featured different characters that you can level up with new skills and classes  as you battle in different maps. Most characters even come with their own lore so players can more understand who they are playing. Although the maps are fun, most people can speed run to the boss and probably one shot it.

A ncie aspect of this game is the PVP but also the most annoying. Some characters come with a spam ability. For example, one of the mages will repeat firebolt (fireball) forever and it goes across map. Another problem with the game is hacking as i did myself. Hacking involved taking out all the enemies at the beginning of the first few stages then auto beating the boss. It was a good run until finally the developers realized what was going on and put in a security to detect thrid party use programs.

## Final Thoughts
The original grandchase will always have a place in my heart but ever since the grandchase reborn, nobody was able to transfer accounts so you have to start all of your progress over.
