## Summary
The room is part of a four game series that is available on PC and mobile, developed by Fireproof Games. Recent news shows that the game was ported to the Nintendo switch with updated graphics.  This three-dimensional game allows to complete control of user interface, meaning if a key needs to be turned, you do a turning touch screen motion and turn the key like you would in real life. The Room is a series of puzzle boxes within a puzzle box and every area around the room connects in some way with each other. The player has to open all boxed that presents different mechanisms, locks, and puzzles within the boxes. Even after you think you solved the puzzle, there is always another one unlocked somewhere else on the same object. 

The Room has a small story but still an interesting read if you manage to find the notes throughout the game. The notes tell of an author, who slowly got consumed by madness, discovered an ethereal material the boxes were using called “Null”. You use a pair of lenses that is made by null and by seeing through it, you see strange symbols that help you progress in the story but just as the author saw visions, you will too. The purpose of what the author in the notes wanted was all knowledge of the “Null” by summoning a demon lord named Astaroth. Even after playing the games, this mystery within the notes seemed unsolved. 

As mentioned, there are several real-life mechanics in the game. The three-dimensional space allows for motions such as sliding, flipping, or rotating for full interaction of gameplay. The idea of the game is to feel as immersed as possible, that you are there manipulating the boxes. In later games such as two and three, the player is able to move around and solve different puzzles within the room. The hook that drives people to play is the design and uniqueness of the games. Simple, yet intriguing. You want to know what complicated puzzles The Room will throw at you and people love brain teasers. This game was able to earn many awards and earn game of the year. 


## Final Thoughts
In my opinion, this is the best puzzle game I have ever played. I was willing to pay the fee which isn't that much just to play. May be frustrating to other people but the graphics and mechanics is what really got me to keep playing and solve more boxes. This game also inspired me to do real life puzzles, escape rooms, and my personal favorite: 3D crystal puzzles. I love the challenge of critical thinking and solving my way out of situations.
