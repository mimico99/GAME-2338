# Game Review for (GAME TITLE)

## Details

### Game Title
Getting Over It

### Rating
I would rate this a 4/5

## Summary
This game doesn't have a purpose but to get to the end. You are introduced into what seems to be an open world map but has many traps. Your character is none other, but a man stuck in a cauldron with his only choice of weapon is a sledgehammer. The objective of the game would be to use your sledgehammer has a mountain pickaxe and climb your way to the top without falling. 

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
