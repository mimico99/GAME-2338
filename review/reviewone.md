### Rating
8/10

## Summary
Back in 2003 where toontown was created,it was owned by disney. Easy to tell by its wacky characters and way of how heavily they enforce child content. With a "leagal guardian", u are not able to experince the full potential of toowntown meaning typing almost anything u want. Another thing about toowntown was that u had to pay for a subscription in order to play. The game was pretty stable until 2013 where disney comepltly discontinued it. Until 2014 where the game was bought by actually, a bunch of high schoolers and college kids. Unknown group but they have managed to keep the game alive. Another perk is that the game is now currently free.

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
