## Details

### Game Title
Getting Over It

### Rating
I would rate this a 4/5

## Summary
This game doesn't have a purpose but to get to the end. You are introduced into what seems to be an open world map but has many traps. Your character is none other, but a man stuck in a cauldron with his only choice of weapon is a sledgehammer. The objective of the game would be to use your sledgehammer has a mountain pickaxe and climb your way to the top without falling.

Now this game is designed to make the average person furious. Falling is probably one of the most devastating things you can do in the game. Ways to get to the bottom is so absurd makes players rage quit and never play again. one of the way is the infamous snake on the upper levels. Taking the snake ride slides you all the way back down to where you first started and getting to the snake was already hard to get to.

To top it all off, Bennett Foddy, the creator of the game, will talk to you in a calming and soothing voice when you fail hardcore or end up stuck in an area. Many youtubers have attempted this game and beat the game eventually but at a price. They beat the game with pure rage for a week or two and broken spirits.


## Final Thoughts
Other than the major rage this game comes with, it was a huge acomplishment and relief to beat but I will never play this game every again. Everyone should recomended to friends and family if you want to ruin relationships.
